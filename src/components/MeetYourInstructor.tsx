            Hi, I'm Himanshu. I've been freelancing for 5 years, transforming
            from living in someone else's garage to owning my home in New Delhi.
            I built a business that earned over 60 Lakhs working with 40+
            international clients. My YouTube channel (49K subscribers) and
            courses have helped 1,500+ students launch successful freelancing
            careersâ€”many starting with just a phone. Through my authentic,
            Hindi-language teaching, I've proven that anyone can access
            international opportunities regardless of their background. My
            mission is simple: to help you transform your life through
            freelancing, just like I did.
          </p>
